## Reproduce my experiment
__0a.__ Preprocess the USDA data to produce these files:
   * `usda farm budget summary (machine readable).xlsx` - Combine the data for relevant crops from __[6]__ into a single Excel file.
   * `usda irrigation summary.xlsx` - Reformat the data from __[4]__ into a machine-readable format.
   * `usda irrigation water requirement.xlsx` - Reformat the data from __[5]__ into a machine-readable format.
   * `nldas_states_counties_regions.csv` - Map grid cells to U.S. state IDs, county IDs, and ERS farm regions; developed as part of this experiment using data from __[1]__ and spatial joins in ArcMap.
   * `water_proportions.csv` - Reformat the data from __[2]__ into a machine-readable format.
   * `water_costs.csv` - Aggregate surface water costs from __[5]__ and aggregate groundwater costs by dividing volume of groundwater irrigation __[2]__ by total groundwater energy cost __[3]__.
   * `cdl_gcam_lookup_v3_notavailcorr.csv` - Map CDL crop types to Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) crop types; developed as part of this experiment.

__0b.__ Download the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) files for 2008-2018 from __[7]__ and preprocess:
   * For each year, sum the pixels for each CDL Crop category within each 1/8 degree North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) grid cell using ArcMap or similar tool; producing files like `cdl_{year}_clean.csv`
   * Run the script `cdl_processing.py` to combine the yearly files into a single file in the expected format: `all_nldas_cdl_data_v3.txt`
__0c.__ Run the script `wmabm_data_process.py` to generate these files: TBD:
   * `crop_ids_by_farm_and_constraint.p` - TBD
   * `crop_ids_by_farm.p` - TBD
   * `gammas_new_20201102_protocol2.p` - TBD
   * `hist_avail_bias_correction_20201102.csv` - TBD
   * `hist_dependent_storage.csv` - TBD
   * `max_land_constr_20201102_protocol2.p` - TBD
   * `MOSART_WM_PMP_inputs_20201028.xlsx` - TBD
   * `net_prices_new_20201102_protocol2.p` - TBD
   * `NLDAS_Grid_Reference.csv` - TBD
   * `nldas_ids.p` - TBD
   * `nldas.txt` - TBD
   * `water_constraints_by_farm_pyt278.p` - TBD

__1.__ The results of step 0a are available as part of the code repository __[11]__; the results of step 0b can be downloaded from __[9]__; the results of step 0c are available as part of the code repository __[12]__.

__2.__ Download and unpack the MOSART-WM-ABM input data from __[8]__ into a supercomputing environment.

__3.__ Clone the MOSART-WM-ABM repository __[12]__ into a supercomputing environment; modifications to the source code may be necessary to run on unsupported machines.

__4.__ From the repository root directory, setup the model with the following shell commands (replacing sections surrounded by curly braces with the specifics of your environment):
   * `./cime/script/create_newcase --case {absolute path to a directory to create for your run} --res NLDAS_NLDAS --compset mosart_runoff_driven --project {cost center for your use of supercomputer}`
   * `cd {absolute path to your run directory}`
   * `./xmlchange DIN_LOC_ROOT={absolute path to your unpacked data directory from step 2}`
   * `./xmlchange DLND_CPLHIST_DIR={absolute path to your unpacked data directory from step 2}`
   * `./xmlchange LND_DOMAIN_PATH={absolute path to your unpacked data directory from step 2}`
   * `./xmlchange RUN_STARTDATE=1940-01-01`
   * `./xmlchange STOP_OPTION=nyears`
   * `./xmlchange STOP_N=70`
   * `./xmlchange JOB_WALLCLOCK_TIME=35:00:00` (_you may need more or less wallclock time depending on machine_)
   * `./xmlchange JOB_QUEUE={name of a job queue in your supercomputing environment}`
   * `./case.setup`

__5.__ Make the following modifications to the file `user_nl_mosart` in the root of your run directory:
   * Change the value of `parafile` to the absolute path to the file of the same name downloaded in step 2.
   * Add a new line with: `frivinp_rtm = '{absolute path to your unpacked data directory from step 2}/MOSART_NLDAS_8th_20160426.nc'`

__6.__ Build the model with the shell command: `./case.build`

__7.__ Submit the model run to the job queue with the shell command: `./case.submit`

__8.__ If all is well, the model will eventually run, generating output and log files into your directory within the supercomputer's scratch file system, including the data found in __[10]__.
